This repo helps you to create a stub runner of contracts, and provides a Docker image to start it.

== Why we need it

In https://github.com/Hippoom/lives-driven-development[lives driven development], we used https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.0.0.M8/single/spring-cloud-contract.html#_customization[extending DSL] for our contracts.
But the dependencies cannot be added into the classpath by default, we have to add it by ourselves.

You can see the dependency in `build.gradle`. This is also an example for you if you are using extending DSl in your contract too.

[source,groovy]
====
dependencies {
  runtime("com.github.hippoom:test-data-builder:${testDataBuilderVersion}")
}

== How to use it

=== With Docker

See in https://hub.docker.com/r/yuexiang/ldd-stub-runner/[DockerHub].

You can start the stub runner by docker-compose, for example:

[source,yml]
====
include::docker-compose.yml[]
====

 You have to set all the 5 environment variables, I'm going to fix this.

=== Without Docker

You can change the configuration in `application.yml` for your contracts.
By default, it read environment variables.

[source,yml]
====
include::src/main/resources/application.yml[]
====
